# Buddywise React Native Code Challenge

## What is it?
Your task is to implement a simple app where user can enter IP address of a digital camera and stream it to the phone.

Simply clone this repo and build on top of the current codebase (its an empty react native project, created with Expo). 
When you are done with your solution, please share a link to your repo via email: yigit@buddywise.co 

## Features
* As a User I should be able to enter the IP address of a digital camera and stream it.
* As a User I should be able to watch the stream in both portrait and landscape mode.
* As a User I should be able to disconnect from the camera and stop streaming it.

## Things to keep in mind ðŸš¨
* Achieving required functionality and good code quality are both important in this challange.
* Your code will be evaluated based on: code structure, programming best practices, legibility. (and *not* extra functionality implemented). 
* The git commit history (and git commit messages) will be also evaluated.

Using third-part libraries is totally ok, and even encouraged, if you clearly state them.

## Some publicly avaiable IP addresses
Here are some publicly available IP addresses you can use for this challenge. (However you don't have to use these, as long as they are accassible by us, you can use any camera source)
